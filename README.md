# Lab Appointment System Frontend

Welcome to the Lab Appointment System frontend repository. This system provides a user interface for managing appointments and generating reports for laboratory tests. This README provides an overview of the frontend architecture, components, setup instructions, and contribution guidelines.

## System Overview

The Lab Appointment System frontend is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It interacts with the backend server, which is developed using Spring Boot, to fetch data and perform operations. The frontend provides a user-friendly interface for users to schedule appointments, view reports, and manage their account settings.

## Components and Their Interactions

### Frontend Components

- **HTML Pages**: Responsible for presenting the user interface to the client.
- **CSS Stylesheets**: Define the visual layout and styling of the HTML elements.
- **JavaScript**: Adds interactivity to the user interface, handling client-side validation and asynchronous requests to the backend server.

### Interaction with Backend

- When a user interacts with the frontend interface, such as booking an appointment or viewing a report, JavaScript sends HTTP requests to the corresponding endpoints on the backend server.
- The backend server processes these requests, performs the necessary operations, and sends back responses containing the requested data or status updates.
- JavaScript then updates the user interface based on the received data or displays error messages if any.

## Setup and Installation

To set up the frontend locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the HTML files in your preferred web browser or set up a local development server using tools like Node.js, npm, or Python's SimpleHTTPServer.
3. Ensure that the frontend can communicate with the backend server by updating the API endpoint URLs if necessary.

## Contributing

Contributions to the Lab Appointment System frontend are welcome! Here are a few ways you can contribute:

- Report bugs or suggest enhancements by opening an issue on GitHub.
- Submit pull requests to fix issues, add new features, or improve the existing codebase.
- Help improve the user experience by providing feedback on the interface design and usability.
